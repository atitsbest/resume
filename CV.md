# Stephan Meißner

Full-Stack Developer, Engineer Manager, ...

I have been around for some time engineering and shipping software, working with may customers of different domains.
Programming is what I love and forming a team for the task at hand, not only managing bits but also humans (as big problems are mostly not technical).

# Skills

## Humans

- Mentored interns, junior and senior developers to develop their skills.
- Conducted workshops for modern web development (backend and frontend).
- Executed Requirements engineering workshops for solid specifications.

## Software

### React.js

- Analyzed other frontend libs/frameworks and choose the React.js - Typescript combination for its type-checked views.
- Learned that react.js with context and hooks is now "complete" and does not need much extra state management.
- Accelerated SPA development by curating an efficient set of libs and conventions around React.js.

### Java-/TypeScript

- Programmed JavaScript for around 15 years now...
- Campaigned that JavaScript is not suited for medium to large scale programs. Never was intended to be. Typescript is.

### CSS

- Not afraid of good design and style sheets. Can think in flex-box and different types of positioning.

### Flutter

- Evaluated Xamarin and React Native but chose Flutter for its joy of usage (I'm always skeptical about (leaky) abstractions, but Flutter works and it is nice to have one code to rule them all.)

### Deprecated

- Knockout.js, Monorail, Angular 1.x & 2.x, WinForms, WebForms, WPF, WCF, MFC (who still knows this one?)

## Backend

### .Net/.Net Core

- Mostly in C#.
- Started with Version 1.1, now .net Core 3.x
- Liked the path C# took, from Generics (that's a must), LINQ (declarative querying), nice async handling (all over the place now).

### ASP.NET

- Anticipated the change from Web.Forms to MVC and used Monorail-MVC in the meantime.
- Access different DBs (MS SQL-Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, AS400 DB2) with appropriate libs (Dapper, Raw, EF (Core))

### Docker

- Write docker files to encapsulate applications (to move between hosting platforms, for faster auto-scaling)
- Used as build platform in ci scenarios.

### Worth mentioning

- Worked on projects (some shipped) with Ruby (with and without Rails) and
- Go (I like the lightning-fast compile times).
